  ## Installation

  On the homepage of my repo, click on the green `Code` button.  Download the zip file and copy it to a directory of your choice or clone to a directory of your choice using your terminal. Open the file in VS Code. Open the terminal in VS Code and make sure you’re in the root directory ‘pro-README-gen'. You’ll now be ready to run the app!

  ## Usage

  After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node index.js’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, the file called `Generated-README.md` will be updated with your changes. It’s generated in mark down syntax so you can copy and paste that code into your project!  Please watch the video linked below for a tutorial.
