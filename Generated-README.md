  ## Installation

  On the homepage of my repo, click on the green Code button. Download the zip file and copy it to a directory of your choice or clone to a directory of your choice using your terminal. Open the file in VS Code. Open the terminal in VS Code and make sure you’re in the root directory ‘ecommerce-backend'. You’ll now be ready to run the app!

  ## Usage

  After installation is complete, run the command npm i to install the packages need for this application. Next, connect to MySQL using mysql -u root -p and enter your password. Use the schema.sql and seeds.sql to set up the database. Finally, run npm start the terminal. Answer the prompts to interact with the database. Please watch the video linked below for a tutorial.
